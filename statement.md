# Welcome!

This Python template lets you get started quickly with a simple one-page playground.

```python runnable
print('Hello World!')
```

This Python template lets you use the name of the user and write a message back to them.

```python runnable
name2="Andy"
print(name2,', very nice to meet you! It is great to have you here with us')
```

# Python program to print odd Numbers in given range
```python runnable
start, end = 4, 19

# iterating each number in list
for num in range(start, end + 1):
	
	# checking condition
	if num % 2 != 0:
		print(num, end = " ")
```

# Advanced usage
